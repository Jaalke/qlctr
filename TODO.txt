Click listeners in calcWindow just call functions in calcDisplay for now, which are public.
This is dumb. Probably just bind the final functions as the listeners themselves, if possible.
(Turns out it's not, at least afaik)

outputParser - attempt to build a simple conversion from floating point to string from scratch, 
currently stuck in limbo. Supposed to be tailored to the calculator display - max digits,
displaying larger/smaller numbers with exp notation etc. The C++ std includes a helpful module called
'format' or some such that provides this functionality - sadly, the good people over at Apple Clang
have not deemed it important enough to include in their compiler.
